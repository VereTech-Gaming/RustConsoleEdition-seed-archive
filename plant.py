"""This file is intended to be for the
Automated Image Stitching portion of process.

A seed is first "germinated".
All raw images are prepared for stitching.

A seed is then "planted".
All fabricated images are stitched into a grid-aligned, cropped image.

A plant is then "pruned".
The final image is compressed to reduce transfer time and load."""
